#'   These had started in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria.
#'   Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of
#'    the Three Emperors (German: Dreikaiserbund) between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary,

#' Columbia University faculty club trying to convince a packed room of potential
#' recruits that Wall Street, not Silicon Valley, was the place to be for computer
#' scientists.\\n\\n The Goldman employees knew they had an uphill battle. They were
#' fighting against perceptions of Wall Street as boring and regulation-bound and
#' Silicon Valley as the promised land of flip-flops, beanbag chairs and million-dollar
#' stock options.\\n\\n Their argument to the room of technologically inclined students
#' was that Wall Street was where they could find far more challenging, diverse and,
#' yes, lucrative jobs working on some of the worlds most difficult technical problems."

#' @details Find IDs of extractors using \url{https://app.monkeylearn.com/main/explore}.
#' Within the free plan, you can make up to 20 requests per minute.
#'
#' You can use batch to send up to 200 texts to be analyzed within the API
#' (classification or extraction) with each request.
#' So for example, if you need to analyze 6000 tweets,
#' instead of doing 6000 requests to the API, you can use batch to send 30 requests,
#' each request with 200 tweets.
#' The function automatically makes these batch calls and waits if there is a throttle limit error,
#' but you might want to control the process yourself using several calls to the function.
#'
#' You can check the number of calls you can still make in the API using \code{attr(output, "headers")$x.query.limit.remaining}
#' and \code{attr(output, "headers")$x.query.limit.limit}.
#'
#' @return A data.frame with the results whose attribute is a data.frame (tibble) "headers" including the number of remaining queries as "x.query.limit.remaining".
#' Both data.frames include a column with the (list of) md5 checksum(s) of the corresponding text(s) computed using the \code{digest digest} function.
